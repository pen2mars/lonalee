# 001. Samsung Electronics Stock Split [Economy]
    1. summary (my own)
        Samsung Electronics' stock split has been done a few days ago,  
        which means the price of one share has been much cheaper than it used to be.  
        The company is pretty much sure that it's gonna draw more investors because of the price.  
        However, there is some concern that Samsung Electronics would have even more influence  
        over the entire stock market, if more people actually invest in Samsung Electronics,  
        and then the Korean stock market might seem to be less valuable since it could be affected by one company.

# 002. AI tech in legal service [IT/SCIENCE]
    1. summary (my own)
        AI technology can help lawyers do reserch.  
        when users put a keyword about a divorce case 
        the legal navigation system can deliver  
        relevant laws and precedents. This system visualizes  
        all the legal codes in Korea, and it can also 
        translate everyday language into legal jargon.
        To gain sufficient knowledge in unfamiliar fields,  
        lawyers should search for laws and precedents and 
        it's time-demanding job. However, they can simply type keywords and get relevant knowledge form the system. This technology is pretty new to Korea but lawyers in the U.S. have been untilizing it already. That's why the creators of this system have applied for patents in Korea and abroad and also hope it'll put Korea in this burgeoning legal service field. On the other hand, concerning the fear over the threat that this technology posesses to lawyers and their jobs, legal experts predict that lawyers' job won't be replaced by this AI technology because of one thing that can't be done by AI, which is making judgement.

# 004. Nomadic life [Etc - life]
    1. summary  (my own)
        The man lives a nomadic life and he can travel anywhere and work there. So he looks up short-term housing or just accommodations on the internet. Because he considers chairs very important, whenever
        he goes to a hotel, he asks if it has a nice and comfortable chair.
        What made me surprised was that he works longer than usual, even though he lives a nomadic life. He mentioned that's because he has 
        so much time. (which is what I can't understand) 
        Plus, he thinks that he is not a traveler but a worker so he doesn't travel but focus on working. He knows which contries have 
        fast internet in Asia.        

    2. Key words (mostly new)

# 006. Women in space

Women haven't had opportunities to step on the moon so far. One of the women astronuts at Nasa was selected as an astronut in the year 2000, and she thought that it wasn't just a dream but something that could happen. However, it's unfortunate she didn't get a chance. The number of women joining as astronut trainees has been increasing and 2016 was the first year that there is an equal number of women and men joining the astronut program. It seems like there is a realistic possibility for women to set foot on the moon. Nowadays, The planet Mars is a big target for space travel. And there is need for many different kinds of specialists. We tend to think of an astronut as a spaceship pilot. But, they're much more like scientists carrying out different experiments. 
Let's say we're going to set up a base on Mars, then, we need to find a way of growing food. So we need various groups of people with skills, which means more opportunities would be coming for women.
