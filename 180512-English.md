# 001. Samsung Electronics Stock Split [Economy]
    1. summary (my own)
        Samsung Electronics' stock split has been done a few days ago,  
        which means the price of one share has been much cheaper than it used to be.  
        The company is pretty much sure that it's gonna draw more investors because of the price.  
        However, there is some concern that Samsung Electronics would have even more influence  
        over the entire stock market, if more people actually invest in Samsung Electronics,  
        and then the Korean stock market might seem to be less valuable since it could be affected by one company.

# 002. AI tech in legal service [IT/SCIENCE]
    1. summary (my own)
        AI technology can help lawyers do reserch.  
        when users put a keyword about a divorce case 
        the legal navigation system can deliver  
        relevant laws and precedents. This system visualizes  
        all the legal codes in Korea, and it can also 
        translate everyday language into legal jargon.
        To gain sufficient knowledge in unfamiliar fields,  
        lawyers should search for laws and precedents and 
        it's time-demanding job. However, they can simply type keywords and get relevant knowledge form the system. This technology is pretty new to Korea but lawyers in the U.S. have been untilizing it already. That's why the creators of this system have applied for patents in Korea and abroad and also hope it'll put Korea in this burgeoning legal service field. On the other hand, concerning the fear over the threat that this technology posesses to lawyers and their jobs, legal experts predict that lawyers' job won't be replaced by this AI technology because of one thing that can't be done by AI, which is making judgement.
